# Numerical Mathematics Homeworks
This repository contains the three homework assignments for the Numerical Mathematics course at the master's level in the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology at the University of Ljubljana. It is divided into three subproblems, each with its own README file providing detailed information about the specific assignment. The content is written in English, as I find it more suitable for this purpose.

## Packages installed
This part of the documentation contains a list list of all packages installed and how to use them.

### Tests
Tests is a testing package in Julia.

### Documenter && DocumenterTools
These two packages come as a bundle for generating documentation. Usage is quite simple:
 - write some well documented code
 - run `julia --project=.. make.jl` inside the `doc` folder
